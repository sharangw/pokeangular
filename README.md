# Pokemon Creator

## Project
* The goal of this project was to create an AngularJS web application using data from the RESTful Pokemon API located here: https://pokeapi.co/
* This application was part of my training program at Revature.

## Tools
* Pokemon Creator is a single page application written in JavaScript with the Angular framework along with HTML, CSS and UI-Bootstrap for front end needs. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. 

## The App
* In this application, one can combine the head of a pokemon and the body of another to create a whole new pokemon and fight with it against random pokemons.
